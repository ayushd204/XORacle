# XORacle
This project implements a simple neural network from scratch using NumPy. The network is trained on a XOR dataset to predict the binary outcome 1/0. It includes fundamental components such as net layers, activation functions, an optimizer, and a loss function.

**Features**
- Sigmoid activation function
- Optimizer for weight updates
- Backpropagation for gradient calculation
- Simple training loop with accuracy tracking

**Requirements**
- There are just two dependencies that need to be installed
pip install numpy matplotlib

**Usage**
- Run the script to train the neural net
python3 usage.py
The model trains for 10000 epochs by default but can be set as per will of the user.
